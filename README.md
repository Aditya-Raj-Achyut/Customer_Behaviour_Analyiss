🚀 Customer Behavior Analysis | End-to-End Data Project

📌 Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze a retail dataset to identify Customer Purchasing Patterns. I performed the end-to-end data lifecycle: extracting raw data, cleaning it using SQL and Python, and finally building an interactive Power BI dashboard to support data-driven business decisions.


🛠️ Tech Stack Used
Data Cleaning & Manipulation: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Database Management: SQL (MySQL/SQLite)

Data Visualization: Power BI & Seaborn/Matplotlib

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


📊 Project Workflow
Data Extraction: Extracted raw datasets from Kaggle.

SQL Analysis: Loaded data into a database to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) like Revenue per Customer and Churn Rate.

Python EDA: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to detect outliers, handle missing values, and analyze correlations.

Dashboarding: Designed a final interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize high-level business insights.


🔍 Key Insights
Customer Segmentation: The 35-50 age demographic contributes to 45% of total revenue.

Retention Issues: Identified that 20% of customers have not made a purchase in the last 6 months (High Churn Risk).

Category Performance: The "Electronics" category has the highest profit margin (12%) but also the highest return rate.
