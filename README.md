# 🚀 Customer Behavior Analysis | End-to-End Data Project

### 📌 Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze a retail dataset to identify **Customer Purchasing Patterns**. I performed the end-to-end data lifecycle: extracting raw data, cleaning it using SQL and Python, and finally building an interactive Power BI dashboard to support data-driven business decisions.
